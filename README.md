# Academic Task Manager

## Course Context

**CSC325 – .NET Software Development**  
Spring 2026 Academic Project

## Project Overview

Academic Task Manager is a full-stack web application designed to help university students organize academic projects and track associated tasks. Built with Blazor Server and .NET 10, the system provides complete CRUD functionality, user authentication, real-time updates, and progress tracking. The application demonstrates modern .NET development practices including Entity Framework Core for data persistence, ASP.NET Core Identity for security, and a service layer architecture pattern for maintainability.

This project was developed to provide students with a practical tool for managing coursework while demonstrating proficiency in enterprise-level .NET technologies suitable for production environments.

## Key Features

- Complete project and task CRUD operations with validation
- User authentication and authorization with ASP.NET Core Identity
- Real-time UI updates via SignalR
- Project statistics and completion tracking
- Responsive Bootstrap 5 interface
- Individual user workspaces with data isolation
- Overdue task detection and visual indicators

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Blazor Server (Razor Components)
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core 10.0
- **Database:** SQLite with Entity Framework Core 10.0
- **Authentication:** ASP.NET Core Identity
- **UI Framework:** Bootstrap 5.3
- **Real-Time:** SignalR

## System Architecture

### Overview

The application follows a three-layer architecture pattern:

1. **Presentation Layer** - Blazor components and pages
2. **Service Layer** - Business logic and data operations
3. **Data Layer** - Entity Framework Core and SQLite

### Authentication & Authorization

ASP.NET Core Identity manages user accounts and authentication. Each user has isolated access to their own projects and tasks. Authorization is enforced at the service layer through user ID validation before any data operation.

**Security Features:**

- Password requirements (min 6 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
- User-specific data isolation
- Development mode auto-confirms email for testing

### Database Configuration

**Database:** SQLite (file-based, located at `Data/app.db`)

**Schema:**

- **AspNetUsers** - Identity user accounts
- **Projects** - Academic projects (Id, Title, Description, CreatedDate, OwnerUserId)
- **Tasks** - Project tasks (Id, Title, Description, DueDate, Status, ProjectId)

**Relationships:**

- User (1) → Projects (N) - Cascade delete
- Project (1) → Tasks (N) - Cascade delete

**Migrations:** Code-first approach with Entity Framework Core migrations

## Running the Application Locally
